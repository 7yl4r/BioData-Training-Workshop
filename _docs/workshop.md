## Workshop Content Details

This first IOOS Biological Data Training Workshop is in collaboration with U.S. OBIS, IOC’s OceanTeacher Global Academy, and OBIS international. The objective of this training workshop is to educate participants in the benefits, goals, technology and process to make biological data resources (and associated physical or chemical data) available in a format that can be ingested by OBIS and the MBON Portal. It will also expose participants to OBIS, IOOS and MBON tools for using those data.

### Agenda

[Folder of presentations](https://github.com/ioos/BioData-Training-Workshop/tree/gh-pages/Workshop_Presentations)

### What Participants Need for Workshop
1. Laptop computer
2. Biological Data set with associated physical/chemical data
3. Knowledge of Python or R programming languages

### Workshop Participant Pre-work
1. Review [OBIS online Darwin Core Course](http://classroom.oceanteacher.org/course/view.php?id=315)
2. Review [Darwin Core Documentation](http://www.iobis.org/manual/darwincore/)
3. Advise organizers on what dataset you will be working with during the training
4. Participate in the pre-Workshop Webex (1-2 weeks prior to training) 

### Guidance on Datasets
To get the most out of this hands on workshop you will need to bring a biological dataset that, at a minimum, has:
1. Lat/lon location of the sample
2. Date the sample was collected 
3. Species name(s)

Data may involve organisms ranging from fish, to invertebrates, phytoplankton and zooplankton, including HABs observations.

### Python and R setups and resources for the workshop
The workshop will rely heavily on R and Python for hands-on exercises and tools. We have set up R and Python instructions and resources to enable participants to set up environments for these programming languages both in participants' computers and on [the cloud (via JupyterHub and RStudio)](https://ioosbiodata.cloudmaven.org). All these resources are found on the workshop GitHub repository at [https://github.com/ioos/BioData-Training-Workshop](https://github.com/ioos/BioData-Training-Workshop). See the [instructions on the README.md file](https://github.com/ioos/BioData-Training-Workshop/blob/master/README.md) for full details.

Note for JupyterHub: You will need to have a github username, and your username sent to us to be able to access the Jupyterhub. If you are having trouble accessing Jupyterhub please send an email to landungs@uw.edu with your github username.
